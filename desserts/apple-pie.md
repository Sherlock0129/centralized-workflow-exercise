## **Instructions**

### **1. Prepare the Pie Crust:**
1. In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, and sugar.  
2. Cut in cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  
3. Gradually add ice water, 1 tbsp at a time, until the dough holds together.  
4. Divide into two discs, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.  

### **2. Make the Apple Filling:**
1. Peel, core, and thinly slice apples (~¼-inch thick).  
2. Toss with lemon juice, sugars, spices, and cornstarch.  
3. Cook in a skillet with butter over medium heat for 5-7 minutes until slightly softened. Let cool.  

### **3. Assemble the Pie:**
1. Roll out one dough disc and fit into a 9-inch pie dish.  
2. Fill with the apple mixture, mounding slightly in the center.  
3. Roll out the second dough disc and place on top (or cut into strips for a lattice crust).  
4. Crimp edges, brush with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar.  
5. Cut a few slits in the top crust for steam to escape.  

### **4. Bake:**
- **425°F (220°C) for 15 min**  
- **Reduce to 375°F (190°C) and bake 40-50 min** until golden and bubbly
